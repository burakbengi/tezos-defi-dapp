# Tezos DeFi DApp
Implementations for common smart contract patterns of popular DeFi applications and a user interface with high-level DeFi functionality. These implementations can be used as templates or starter kits to bootstrap new applications, therefore, greatly increasing developer productivity at the start of new projects.
Checkout a [demo](https://tezosdefidapp.netlify.app/).

## Getting started
A quick introduction to the minimum setup you need to get a Tezos DeFi DApp up and running.

### Prerequisites
To set up a development environment, follow the links below to see installation instructions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) (v10.20.1 or higher)
- [Ligo](https://ligolang.org/docs/intro/installation) (the latest version)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable) (v1.12.3)
- [React](https://reactjs.org) (v16.13.1)

### Setting up a development environment

```shell
git git@github.com:protofire/tezos-defi-dapp.git
cd tezos-defi-dapp/
yarn install
```

### Contracts
The contracts are located in the folder [defi-contracts](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-defi-dapp/blob/master/defi-contracts) .
For more details, you can check out the [README](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-defi-dapp/blob/master/defi-contracts/README.md) file.

### Application
The React-based application can be found in the [defi-dapp](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-defi-dapp/blob/master/defi-dapp) folder.

### Oracle
We use an Oracle only for showing the USD on the react frontend. For more information about how the oracle works you can check the [oracle repository](https://github.com/protofire/tezos-price-oracle).

### Exchange Rate
Currently the exchange rate is being calculated as follows
```shell
(totalDeposits + totalBorrows) / tokenSupply
```
You can check it in the file `poolInterest.ligo`. Soon we will include several changes like management of multiple assets, prices, fees, etc, and this formula will be modified.
